# Idtech-AI2
Final project for ID Tech Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with NVIDIA course
My project was meant to be a pc security extension that gave device access to the owners, or "Familiars", and restricted access from others, or "Strangers". 
My demonstration would have included the running of the code, 
which would've created a GUI including a live display of the video feed from the camera of the person trying to sign in, 
and a prediction of who was detected (snippets of code from the Week 4 Thumbs Project), 
before it ran for another one hundred seconds and finished. 
At that point, in a real situation, what would follow, 
would either be the computer's regular sign-in process (if a "Familiar" was recognized) or a restriction message telling the user that access was denied (if a "Stranger" was detected). 
I tested the bits of my code that originated from the thumbs project individually in Jupiter and verified that they worked. 
However, once I tried to run the code outside of the docker container in Jupiter I ran issues with the import statements. 
Unfortunately, there was not enough support during the last week of the course and office hours (last person did not even know Linux) 
to help me get past technical issues to create a response video or submission.
